    # this option tells devspace to automatically wrap the Dockerfile entrypoint in memory
    # with a small restart helper script so that the process can be easily restarted from within the
    # container. This should work with most Dockerfiles that have an ENTRYPOINT statement.
    # This will also work for build targets.
    # Note: If you override the entrypoint in the kubernetes yaml via the Pod.spec.containers.command,
    # please make sure you wrap the command with the devspace script '/devspace-restart-helper'

    # If you don't have an entrypoint defined in your Dockerfile, you can also define an entrypoint here
